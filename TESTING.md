## Bugs
+ ### Solved bugs
 1. Encoundered issues with main background image fitting on the screen, this was fixed by using flex.

 2. Found issue when trying to impliment my response page, I added the meta code "refresh" on all pages causing the pages to refresh constantly. By adding a seperate page for response and only implimenting the code there, i fixed the issue.

    + ### Mistakes
      - Made a mistake on vs code losing my progress. Managed to save my work but not the repository progress before the error.
     
      - Made a mistake while commiting changes. I used past tense when adding commits. I've learned to use simple present commits going forward.
